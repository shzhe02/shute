# Shute

Shute is an abstraction layer/library built on top of [wgpu](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu).

The goal of this library is to simplify the CPU-side code necessary for executing compute shaders.

# Quickstart

For now, please refer to the examples present in the [examples folder](https://github.com/shzhe02/shute/tree/main/examples).

A more in-depth quickstart guide and improved documentation is coming soon.
